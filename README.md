- Implement Unregularised Logistic regression for 2-class problem using:
 - Update rules mentioned in class slides with gradient descent [Slide 26 from https://nipunbatra.github.io/ml2021/lectures/logistic-regression.pdf] [1 mark]
 - Use Jax/Autograd to automatically compute gradient and solve with gradient descent [1 mark]
 - Using breast cancer dataset and K=3 folds present the overall accuracy. [1 mark]
 - Plot decision boundary for 2d input data where you can choose any two pairs of features to visualise [1 mark]

- Implement L1 and L2 regularised logistic regression for 2-class problem using:
 - Jax/Autograd [1 mark]
 - Using nested cross-validation find the optimum lambda penalty term for L2 and L1 regularisation. From the L1 regularisation, can you infer the “more” important features? [2 marks]


- Implement K-class Logistic regression using:
 - Update rules in slides [Slide 38 from https://nipunbatra.github.io/ml2021/lectures/logistic-regression.pdf] [1 mark]
 - Jax/Autograd [1 mark]
 - Using Digits dataset and stratified (K=4 folds) visualise the confusion matrix and present overall accuracy. Which two digits get the most confused? Which is the easiest digit to predict?  [3 mark]
 - Use PCA (as blackbox) from sklearn and project the digit data to 2 dimensions and make a scatter plot with different colours showing the different digits. What can you infer from this plot? [1 mark]


- What is time and space complexity for Logistic regression learning and prediction? [1 mark]
- Create a fully connected NN (MLP) where the input is X, y, [n1, n2, …, nh] where ni is the number of neurons in i^th hidden layer, [g1, g2, …, gh] where gi in {‘relu’, ‘identity’, ‘sigmoid’} are the activations for i^th layer. You should use Jax for backpropagation. You should write the forward pass yourself. [3 marks]
- Test NN code for simple classification (Digits dataset)  and regression dataset (Boston housing) both using 3-fold CV. You can choose the number of layers and activations of your choice. [3 marks]
